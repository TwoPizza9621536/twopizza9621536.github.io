To send secure and encrypted messages, use KeyBase, Signal or other methods
other than pgp emails. Use the following keys to encrypt and verify files.

Only as a last resort, for using PGP to send encrypted emails to set up a secure
message conversation. My PGP Keys are at:

- [Mailvelope Key Server](https://keys.mailvelope.com)
- [PGP Global Directory](https://keyserver.pgp.com/)

My PGP Keys' IDs are:
`B9D7 159E 235F 7A9B` for EdDSA and
`414C 9CCB FA50 7345` for RSA. These should match the bottom half
of the fingerprints. The keys are generated on 10-24-2021.
