projects, and website for other groups that I am apart of are subjected under
their own ToS and Privacy Policy.

I am not liable for any damages that you cause on your system from reading this

## 2. HTTPS Secured

By default for GitHub Pages that has the default github.io domain HTTPS is
enforced under GitHub own domain and it is available for custom domains by
checking Enforce HTTPS in the settings page of your GitHub repository for your
site.
GitHub Pages uses the certificate authority [Let's Encrypt][1] for HTTPS.[^1]

## 3. No Analytics

---

There is no analytics, google or third party, non of them is on the website,
projects and applications. I do not care how many people visit this website or
telemetry if my application crashes. It the application does not work file a
bug report or issue in the repository for the application.

There no logs or IP Address recorded and stored for me to be able to track you.

But there are excptions like webmasters and analysis to this which are listed
below in [Section 8](#8-exceptions).

## 4. No Cookies

---

No tracking cookies and third party cookies will be stored on your computer.
There is no way that I can track you.

Use [Cookie Metrix][2] to see the cookies that can be stored on the website or
other cookie explorer extensions to check any cookies. There should be none.

## 5. Mostly No JavaScript

---

JavaScript are in a separate section that is apart of the main content.
To see them, click the JavaScript link in the navigation bar.
JavaScript are in the repository with the exception of jQuery[3] which is on an
CDN[^2] provided by [StackPath][4].

## 6. Projects And Applications

---

The projects and applications are under a Open Source license. Mainly BSD-alike
licenses. Anyone can use them for anything that the license permits if the
conditions are met for the license. As stated above there is no analytics and
tracking in the applications.

## 7. Contributing

---

If you contribute, you need to ask the owner of the project so code and credit
are done correctly. You must follow the Code of Conduct and contributing guidelines
before contributing as there are privacy standers in theme. The license of the
project must be followed and license of the code from other projects must be
followed too.

## 8. Exceptions

There is some exception to these rules here it is below:

The social media and 3rd parties APIs provided by them like Google,
Microsoft, Twitter, Discord, etc are under their ToS, and Privacy Policy.
Please check their policy before using applications that uses their APIs.

For Twitter bots and applications, there will be analysis but the data will be
public and no private data will be stored. There will be a notice and warning
saying that the tweet is a poll/servery. Tags are tracked for performance and
vitality only.

For Google and Bing's webmasters, they are only used for SEO and source code
improvements.

There are logs and performance trackers for usage and errors
but I will not use the logs but the performance trackers will be used for
troubleshooting and source code improvements.
