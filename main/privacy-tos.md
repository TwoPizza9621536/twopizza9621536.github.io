Well I need a privacy policy and I want to mind my privacy and yours. I mostly
try to keep my privacy while using major services. Since you might mind yours
here it and this is inspired by [Kev Quirk](https://kevq.uk).

license. There are no telemetry in these projects and you can check the source
code on GitHub.

If you contribute, you must make sure the code that you contribute is entirely
yours. You must follow the Code of Conduct and contributing guidelines
