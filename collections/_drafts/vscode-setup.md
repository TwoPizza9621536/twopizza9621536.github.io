Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is one of the popular most text editor and it's
mostly lightweight compared to IDEs like Visual Studio or JetBrains (lets be
real, VSCode is really a glorified chromium browser for editing text). I have
try other text editors like NeoVim, based on Vim and Lua being its main
programming language for plugins. But NeoVim is mainly a terminal editor and
its keybindings can be hard to master with it being modal, having to switch to
different modes. Another popular editor rivaling VSCode is Sublime Text. Sublime
Text very lightweight and does have extensions it cost about $100 to use and
have to keep paying for more updates so I never used it. Atom was GitHub's text
editor before it was killed in 2022. The last time I used Atom their extensions
wasn't working and Microsoft was going to replace it with VSCode.
