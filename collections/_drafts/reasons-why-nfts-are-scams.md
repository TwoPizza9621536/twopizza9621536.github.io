Non Fungible Tokens or NFTs in recent months have been a very controversial
technology not just in the tech world but also in the art world. I know I am
going to get flamed by tech bros on how "Web3" will change the world and how
people will actually own digital property, but in actuality it is a way for
scammers to gain more money.

This article was still in draft during 2022. I
did not finish this as many other people have voice their options on NFTs. But
since this article is mostly finished, I have rewritten this article for a
less wordy explanation.

## How NFT works

First off what is a NFT. A NFT is a unique and non-interchangeable unit of data
stored on a blockchain, a form of digital ledger - [Wikipedia][1]
([CC BY-SA 3.0][2]). Basically a receipt or transaction "proves" that
you have a digital asset, which cannot be copied and records it in a blockchain.
Then how do you create a NFT, well below is a simple diagram that I have created
to show the process.

![A diagram that shows how a digital asset is minted as a NFT. Starting with
 a digital asset, then the minting process, and lastly putting the NFT on the
 blockchain.]({% asset_path nft_process.svg %} "The process of minting a NFT")

Ok that diagram

Well then why can people can copy assets that are minted as NFTs. Because only
the receipt representing the asset, the NFT, is not copyable, original digital
asset is copyable.

### How "Digital Copying" Works

You are not getting a copy of the original digital asset when you mint an NFT,
you are just getting the representation of that digital asset which is an
imperfect copy of that digital asset. Which is copied when uploaded to the
internet and blockchain which is compressed to show the asset. So why are you
guys crying about someone screenshot your NFT, that is a imperfect copy and does
not affect the real digital asset because you only own a token that only
represent the 1s and 0s of the asset.

### Copyright

Because of the reasons above, you do not own the copyright of the digital asset,
and if you scroll down to the Copyright section in the wikipedia entry, you
cannot prove that you own it in the copyright world. NFT is not a legal document
or legal license that states you own the rights to that asset. It is just a file
on a computer, nothing else.

## How NFTs Ruined Cryptocurrency

Lets admit it, the people who thinks NFTs are the people who now thinks that
cryptocurrency is bad. Do not say that we did not know it is bad because back
when bitcoin started back in 2008, we laugh at it. Then we started to realize
the potential of cryptocurrency, and next it crash because of nfts.

Cryptocurrencies have real use case like anonymous donations which protects the
donator which becomes a double edge sword. Yes, it can be used for criminal acts
but it is about how the technology used, not the existent of the technology. But
that is an other day.

That is ruined when crypto gets an bad reputation from something that really
does not have anything to back it up.
