I am a 17 year old Chinese American who likes to code, play video games and
messing with technology.

I have two names: <span translate="no">Samuel Wu</span> and
<ruby lang="cmn" translate="no">
  吴申榕<rp>(</rp><rt>Wū ShēnRóng</rt><rp>)</rp>
</ruby>.
The former name is the only legal recognized name and the latter is only for
unofficial Chinese, Japanese and Korean use.

I also have done [Linux From Scratch][lfs] in 2019 and the id is 29239.
