## PGP Keys

Pretty Good Privacy keys are provided for:

- Verifying Git Commits, messages, files, and accounts that I own.
- Encrypting and sending messages or files through Email (not recommended).

My fingerprint is `4FD4 4C7B A817 716A 1F8A A923 00E0 54F1 90A6 9373` and
below are key servers which hold my public key.

- [Mailvelope](https://keys.mailvelope.com)

Verification of my accounts is provided by [Keyoxide][1].

## Secure Messages

Please do not use DM or Email to send any private information as most of them
do not use end to end encryption, provide forward secrecy, and anybody can see
these messages. Please use [Signal][2] or [SimpleX][3] for advanced people. My
Signal username is `TwoPizza9621536.01`.
